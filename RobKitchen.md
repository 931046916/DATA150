Chris Anderson believes that models are no longer criticle for modern sciences. Reseachers can simply push data into a computer and wait for the computing clusters to work out a correlation or analysis of the data. Scientists don't need to make any hypothesis before using the data to test it. The success of Google and Amazon seem to verify this point since they can rely on algorithms to make recommendation to consumers without actually knowing the exact information of what the consumer has bought or wish to buy.  

Rob Kitchen, however, maintains the importance of model and human intervention in sciences. Relying completely on computers can indeed save time for formulating hypothesis and can avoid biases from human operation, but in some social science realm, such as art or analyzing the constitution of eographic concentration of different ethnic communities, there are many factors that can't be quantified or processed simply by machine. Moreover, humans are likely to be irrational so that they don't necessarily follow a general rule. Human societies are complex and human activities are tend to be influenced by contingencies, making human behaviors hard to predict.
