As human mobility increases continuously, pathogens are carried to countries with streams of people. In 2016, more than one billion people live outside their places of origin and there are more than 740 million migrants. Millions of people travel internationally and domestically every week and such flow of people will continue to increase in the following years. Therefore, for sake of granting people healthy life, it is crucial to quantify human mobility across multiple temporal and spatial scales. This article aims to investigate on the internal human migration flows in malaria epidemic countries and predict the volume of migrants in certain years; thus, health agencies could take measures accordingly to intervene the possible transmission of those contagious pathogens and diseases. Within the sustainable development goals, good health and well-being is related to this article. 

This article selects malaria as an example of the epidemics and applied multiple types of data to establish a model that predicts of migrants’ mobility. The article uses functions to estimate migration flows between administrative units and then provides tables containing the microdata of internal migration from 2005 to 2010 as well as supplementary data to improve the predictive power of the model. The article also applies Generalized Additive Modelling to replace linear predictors and build possible non-linear relationship by incorporating regression coefficients. To present the illustration of the final predictions, the article uses raster/grid data: illustrating estimated internal human migration flows between subnational administrative units for every malaria endemic country in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. 

According to Amartya Sen, human development requires the removal of major sources of unfreedom. Diseases caused by contagious pathogens exert health risks to the epidemic countries, which is exactly a manifestation of unfreedom that needs to be eliminated. By establishing a predictive model for malaria epidemic countries, the scholars provide better guidelines at both national and international level and enable health agencies in these countries to design more effective malaria elimination plans. 

This study, however, also has some limitations. For example, the modelling sample selected from each country is not sufficiently large; the data (i.e. 2005-2010) may be too old to generalize to temporary situations (major socioeconomic changes may have taken place); this model only estimates permanent human movements, that it to say seasonal movement or forced displacements are not considered. The predict power of this model is inevitably weakened by these factors, but it can still function as a reference for local health bureaus to formulate malaria control measures.

The former article discusses the spread of malaria along with human migration and this article, in response, discusses different countries’ approaches to eliminate malaria. Although annual death caused by malaria is decreasing in recent decades and many countries are approaching parasite-elimination, malaria would not completely disappear in a short period of time and, because of human movements internationally, it might be reintroduced to countries that had once overcame it. Since this article is about disease dynamics, it is also related to the goal of health and well-being in human development and “a long and healthy life” dimension. 

The scholars use mobile phone data to reflect international movements and then use logistic regression models to predict the proportions of people from certain geographical unit who moved to another unit within a period of time. Another 2 figures are presented to show the correlations between mobile phone data and the microdata of international movements. There are 5 raster data figures that show the population flow, probability of leaving, flow of infected people, relative import/export rate, and community structure of infected people. However, these scholars admit that the simplicity of this model implies its inability to capture the complex patterns of human activity, nor can it reflect the observed interpersonal heterogeneity, which is essential for eliminating malaria.

The article compares Haiti people’s movement and Mesoamerican movement and comes to conclude that people tend to migrate into more urbanized cities where population is highly dense and are inclined not to leave an urbanized city. Malaria is thus transmitted between places. Such migration is caused by the inequality between urbanized and unurbanized cities. If more resources, public facilities and more opportunities are available in smaller cities, there would be less migration triggered by urbanization. The existing state of current development is marked by Amartya Sen as unfreedom: less urbanized cities do not enjoy the same level of “instrumental freedoms” as highly urbanized cities.
