# Literature Review  
## Spead of infectious disease in Africa  

### Introduction
In this literature review, I will focus on the spread of infectious diseases. The region I chose to look at is Africa. This is because compared to western countries, more African countries suffer more from contagious health issues and there are more sources available for African countries than Asian countries; there are even special health programs that work with local communities to improve health conditions in Africa. Therefore, I think it is meaningful to study relevant materials and learn more about the health issues in this community. I would explore this topic from 3 aspects: what factors caused the spread of pathogens in Africa; what impacts did these diseases caused and what are the several measures taken by people in attempt to tackle this problem. 

At the beginning of the 21st century, infectious diseases caused at least 10 million deaths each year, which consists of nearly a quarter of deaths worldwide. Some generally recognized factors for emerging infectious diseases includes microbial adaptation, human susceptibility to infection, economic development and land use, climate and weather, human demographics and behavior, changing ecosystems, international travel and commerce, technology and industry, breakdown of public health measures, poverty and social inequality, war and famine, lack of political will and intent to harm. (Fenollar, F., & Mediannikov, O. 2018). Africa, as a typical case, is represented by most of these factors, which causes Africa to be the origin of many infectious diseases. 

According to Amartya Sen, development means granting freedom to people and remove unfreedom from the society. Not only are African people’s well-beings are affected by infectious diseases, once the diseases are spread to other places of the world, this will cause threat to people around the whole world. Methods like gravity model, radiation model are used. In some articles, authors also use algorithm models like XGBoost, K-NN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, ExtraTree, AdaBoost, etc.  

### Spread of infectious diseases due to climate changes and human mobility
Transmission of infectious diseases has three determinants: the pathogen, the vector and the transmission environment. According to this rule in order for the pathogen to survive, reproduce and eventually successfully transmit, a favorable environment is important. However, it is hard to determine the exact relation between climate change and infectious diseases given the existence of different climate variables, disease types and environmental settings in addition to spatial segregation and time lag effects. The data are categorized based on Webber's infectious disease classification system. The effect of temperature variability is visualized in a spatial map and a Climate-disease-method-scale thematic network is built from niche modelling. 

Apart from climate issues, Human mobility is another major influencing factor for disease spreading. For some countries in Africa where mobile phones are widely used by nearly all citizens, call detailed records (CDR) can be used as a pretty reliable indicator in measuring the migration at multiple temporal and spatial scales. For example, Namibia, in southern Africa, is a country where one major network operator obtains more than 76% of market share and provides network spatial coverage 75% population. Once the mobile phone data are proved useful, predicting human movement in Namibia would become much easier. To achieve the goal, researchers used three models that are non-spatial regression approaches: CDR-based linear models, gravity-type spatial interaction models and GTSIMs. CDR-based linear models refers to taking CDR-derived data and combine them with the covariates (including potential migration-related demographic, socioeconomic, environmental, and geographic variables like labor force participation, marital status, educated population by region, etc.), that are used in gravity model. Pearson correlation coefficients was initially used to assess how well CDR represent the census migration data. Then, by using simple the Gravity-type spatial interaction models, a proportional relationship is established between the flow of population and total population while there is an inversely proportional between flow of population and distance. Given Namibia’s small population, the researchers only tested their models by replacing the total population variable with the percentage of the population living in urban areas and the amount of precipitation at the place of origin and destination in order to prevent overfitting. In this case of predicting migration flow, the output of logistic regression model and the estimates of Poisson regression model should be the same. Therefore, the researchers only fit GTSIM to a logistic regression function. CGTSIM with other CDR variables was tested to evaluate how CDR-derived migration data can improve the performance of the gravity model. (Lai, S., Erbach-Schoenberg, E.z., 2019) After fitting the census statistics to each model, the dataset was split to calculate indicators like RMSE and R-squared. The model with the smallest MSE value is the one with best performance. The result verified that CDR is a good indicator to estimate migration. Once human movement can be predicted, the transmission of pathogens could be better monitored and even prevented in advance.  

For some countries in west Africa, however, human mobility data are not readily available, so scientists have to build models to estimate the migration pattern by analyzing the general fluxes between districts. The first model used is the gravity model. In this model, researchers assume that there is a log-linear relationship between the relative flow of regional population and the distance between regions, so the model emphasizes the attractiveness of large population centers. The radiation model also considers the size and distance of the starting and ending populations, but also considers the extraction of other populations within the same radius. Therefore, assuming that each area has the potential to compete with each other, the radiation model will reflect the possible ways of commuting. The adjacency network encodes the number of regional boundaries that an individual needs to cross when moving from one area to another. Therefore, this indicator reflects the influence of national and subnational borders on regional movements. Each of these models has proven to be useful, depending on local conditions, and can infer daily commuting patterns, long-term movements, and overall population diffusion processes. We used these three indicators and their interactions to capture possible unexpected effects, but these indicators alone cannot describe these indicators. These indicators are terms used in disease transmission models. There are many other possible movement models, such as Markov models, but they usually require high-resolution information about the user's personal trajectory.
