# Literature Review  
## Spead of infectious disease in Africa  

### Introduction
In this literature review, I will focus on the spread of infectious diseases. The region I chose to look at is Africa. This is because compared to western countries, more African countries suffer more from contagious health issues and there are more sources available for African countries than Asian countries; there are even special health programs that work with local communities to improve health conditions in Africa. Therefore, I think it is meaningful to study relevant materials and learn more about the health issues in this community. I would explore this topic from 3 aspects: what factors caused the spread of pathogens in Africa; what impacts did these diseases caused and what are the several measures taken by people in attempt to tackle this problem. 

At the beginning of the 21st century, infectious diseases caused at least 10 million deaths each year, which consists of nearly a quarter of deaths worldwide. Some generally recognized factors for emerging infectious diseases includes microbial adaptation, human susceptibility to infection, economic development and land use, climate and weather, human demographics and behavior, changing ecosystems, international travel and commerce, technology and industry, breakdown of public health measures, poverty and social inequality, war and famine, lack of political will and intent to harm. (Fenollar, F., & Mediannikov, O. 2018). Africa, as a typical case, is represented by most of these factors, which causes Africa to be the origin of many infectious diseases. 

According to Amartya Sen, development means granting freedom to people and remove unfreedom from the society. Not only are African people’s well-beings are affected by infectious diseases, once the diseases are spread to other places of the world, this will cause threat to people around the whole world. Methods like gravity model, radiation model are used. In some articles, authors also use algorithm models like XGBoost, K-NN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, ExtraTree, AdaBoost, etc.
